Hello, my name is Vishal Kalansooriya and I'm from Galle, Sri Lanka. I am the CEO and the Chief Software Engineer of Webnifix, a creative Software Development Company where you can do all of your Technical Projects at the best price and learn everything about Technology for free.

I'm currently an Undergraduate Student at SLIIT Academy following the Certificate Course in Information and Technology and I aspire to receive a BSc Hon's Computer Science Software Engineering Degree from University of Bedfordshire England.

I worked as a Professional Software Engineer, Web Developer, Blogger and a Youtuber and I still continue doing so even after being the CEO of my own Company. I had my Primary Education at Amarasuriya College Meepawala and had my Secondary Education at Richmond College Galle.

Aside from doing all these I always try to do my best and I enjoy my free time by helping others to find solutions to their Technical Issues.
